Predicting Breast Cancer - Supervised Learning Approach


Breast cancer is considered one of the most common cancers in women caused by various clinical, lifestyle, social, and economic factors. Machine learning has the potential to predict breast cancer based on features hidden in data.


This project aimed to predict breast cancer using different machine-learning approaches applying laboratory, and mammographic data of the a tumor. 
In this project, I used publicly available University of California, Irvine (UCI) breast cancer database. The database contained 699 independent records, 33% of which belonged to breast cancer patients containing 11 attributes in each record. 

The K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) were used in this project. The data was initially analyzed and pre-processed, and then trained with two classifier models. The model were compared based on their performance on the validation data. 


Based on the evaluation, both KNN and SVM were equally good in predicting breast cancer. On the validation set, KNN accuracy was 0.97 and SVM also had an accuracy score of 0.97.

Based on this project, I believe that a robust machine-learning model could predict breast cancer with good accuracy and can help healthcare professionals in early detection of this disease.
